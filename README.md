# StagEz.js
## It's so EeeeeeeeZeeeee!

A simple little file I made to make my game making "ez"er. Of course you can use it too, if you want. Canvases are referred to as "stages" in this, and there is less typing and thinking involved if you use it. It is just straight to the point and simple. I will be updating this.
